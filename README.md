This is my first project from "The Odin Project "
In this project i created a web site with recipes 
I used my knowledge from The Odin Project , here they are :
I used basic html code 
I used different types of titles
I used absolute and relative links 
I used ordered and unordered lists 
I used images 
I used text editors like bolt<strong> and italic<em> 
And I connected the main page with the other pages with relative links and make the first two to open in another page
