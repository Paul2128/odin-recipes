        <h2 class="title">The best Cheese Omelette</h2>
            <p id="child"><em>This cheese omelette is great for breakfast.When cooking an omelette, it's important that you keep the temperature on the low side, as you don't want it to turn brown.</em></p>
        <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="unordered list">
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li><strong>Step</strong>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step</strong>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
            <li><strong>Step</strong>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
